## Landing Page
A landing page is a specially designed web page that serves as an entry point for visitors, typically created with a specific goal in mind, such as promoting a product, service, or gathering user information. 

### Fruit-Shop Landing Page
I created code on Fruit-Shop Landing Page.It showcases a fruit shop's offerings with captivating visuals, detailed information about apple varieties, and a user-friendly registration form to engage potential customers. The ultimate goal is to attract potential customers, generate interest in the fruit shop's products, and encourage user engagement through registrations.
